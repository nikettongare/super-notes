# Trees 

- A tree is a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges. Each node contains a value or data, and nodes are connected in such a way that they form a hierarchy.


Root: The top node in a tree.
Parent: A node that has one or more child nodes.
Child: A node that has a parent node.
Leaf: A node with no children.
Subtree: A tree consisting of a node and its descendants.
Depth: The length of the path from the root to a node.
Height: The length of the path from a node to the deepest leaf.
