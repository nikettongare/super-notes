# Tell me about yourselft

As you know my name is Niket Tongare, and I live in Chatrapatti Sambhaji Nagar, Maharashtra.

I recently completed my post-graduation from MGM University. Before that, I did my graduation at the same university.

I have done part-time freelancing for three years, where I provided services to develop Flutter and MERN stack applications.

After that, I contributed to a startup called LowCodeApi, where I worked on its core features, completed more than 40 third-party integrations, and developed their sub-products, learning new ideas and skills along the way.

I then completed a four-month Full Stack Development Internship at Marduk Technologies, where I contributed to the development of business management software using web technologies and React Native for mobile applications.

Regarding my technical skills, they include JavaScript, TypeScript and its frameworks, Flutter, Dart, SQL and NoSQL databases, Docker, NGINX, DevOps, and many more.

My short-term goal is to get a job in a good company and work there for at least two years. My long-term goal is to start a bootstrap startup.

I love to learn new things and create new products.

That's all about me.
