# Linux

- Open Source
- Linux refers to the kernel
- These Linux distributions combine the Linux kernel with various software packages, utilities, libraries, and a graphical user interface (if included) to form complete operating systems.

## What is kernel ?

- The kernel is the core component of an operating system. It serves as a bridge between software and hardware, managing system resources and providing essential services for other software running on the system.
- Key features:
  - Hardware Abstraction: It abstracts the hardware complexities, providing a uniform interface for software programs to access hardware resources like CPU, memory, storage, and devices.
  - Process Management: It handles the execution of processes, scheduling tasks, and managing their communication and synchronization.
  - Memory Management: Allocates and deallocates memory for processes, manages virtual memory, and handles memory protection to prevent processes from interfering with each other.
  - Device Drivers: It includes drivers to interact with hardware components such as network interfaces, graphics cards, USB devices, etc.
  - File System Management: It provides access to files and directories, managing file permissions, and facilitating data storage and retrieval.
- Diffrent Kernels
  - Windows NT kernel
  - Linux kernel
  - macOS kernel ( Unix based )

## History

- YT video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShcR4Zfc6Dw&ab_channel=Fireship
- Linus Torvalds - 1991
  - His goal to create the free version on minix operating system
  - minix is based on unix

## Linux file system doesn't knows any file extension

## Directory Structure

- `/`: House (mount point, root file system)
  - `/bin`: Essential command binaries -> never touch
  - `/boot`: System boot loaders files ( kernel files ) -> never touch
  - `/dev`: Device files
  - `/etc`: Host-specific system-wide configuration files
  - `/home`: User home directory
  - `/lib`: Shared library modules
  - `/media`: Media file such as CD-ROM
  - `/mnt`: Temporary mounted filesystems
  - `/opt`: Add-on application software packages
  - `/proc`: Automatically generated file system
  - `/root`: Home directory for root user
  - `/run`: Run-time program data
  - `/sbin`: System Binaries -> never touch
  - `/srv`: Site-specific data served by this system
  - `/sys`: Virtual directory providing information about the system
  - `/tmp`: Temporary files
  - `/usr`: Read only user files
    - `/bin` - User's bin to store user specific data
    - `/sbin` 
    - `/etc`
    - `/local`
      - `/bin`
      - `/sbin`
  - `/var`: Files that is exprected to continuously change

- check filepermission using `ls -l`

```
r -> read
w -> write
x -> exicute

- (dash) at starting means its file
d at staring means its directory

        -             rwx      rwx      rwx
 file/directory       user    group    other

samples:
-rw-r--r--  -> its means
                first - (dash) means its a file
                rw- means user can read, write but can not exicute file
                r-- means group can only read the file
