- What is a Computer?
A computer is an electronic device that processes data to perform tasks. It can store, retrieve, and process data, and it can be programmed to execute a variety of functions.

- Components of a Computer:
    - Central Processing Unit (CPU): Often referred to as the brain of the computer, the CPU performs calculations and executes instructions.
    - Memory (RAM): Random Access Memory (RAM) stores data that is actively being used or processed by the CPU.
    - Storage (Hard Drive, SSD): It provides long-term storage for the operating system, applications, and user data.
    - Motherboard: A circuit board that connects and allows communication between various components, including the CPU, memory, and peripherals.
    - Input Devices: Devices that allow users to provide data or instructions to the computer. Examples include keyboards, mice, touchscreens, and microphones.
    - Output Devices: Devices that display or present processed information to the user. Examples include monitors, printers, and speakers.
    - Software:
        - Operating System (OS): Software that manages hardware resources and provides services for computer programs.
        - Applications: Programs designed to perform specific tasks, such as word processors, web browsers, and games.
    - NIC: Network Interface Card 

- Types of Computers:
    - Personal Computers (PCs): Used by individuals for general computing tasks.
    - Servers: Provide services, resources, or data to other computers on a network.
    - Mainframes: Powerful computers used for large-scale data processing.
    - Supercomputers: Designed for high-performance computing tasks, such as scientific simulations.
